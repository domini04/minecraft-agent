# Minecraft Agent - Project Instructions

## Decision-Making Protocol
- NEVER make key decisions on the user's behalf. When a decision point arises:
  1. Explain the available choices with pros/cons
  2. You MAY suggest a recommended option with reasoning
  3. WAIT for the user's explicit approval before proceeding
  4. Do NOT move on to the next topic until the current decision is confirmed
- This applies to: technology choices, architecture decisions, scope definitions, trade-offs, and any point where multiple valid paths exist
